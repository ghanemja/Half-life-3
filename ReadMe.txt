Welcome to JKTNT!

This program displays a game catalog, similar to that of Steam, where you can browse, add, comment on games and more. 

Once registered, there are three kinds of users that can interact with this software.
All kinds of users can login and out of the application, and a pop-up window will arise to alert of a successful/unsuccessful login/logout.

Administrators and Moderators have all the capabilities of a regular user in addition to the ones listed under their header below: 

1. Users: 
  - Make comments
  - Rate games
  - Search for games
  - Filter/sort through games based on:
        - alphabetical (a-to-z and z-to-a)
        - rating (high-low/low-high)
        - price (high-low/low-high)
  - Submit a game request (to add a game to the catalog) 
        - Must be logged in to do this
        - Button above by search bar 
        - Once this request is submitted, user must wait for request to be approved by the admin.
2. Administrators (admin):
  - All functionality of Users shown above
  - Add games to the catalog
